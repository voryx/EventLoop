# Auto creates and starts the react interop event loop

This library does nothing more than create a react event loop factory and register it to start when the script runs `register_shutdown_function`

## Usage Example
There's nothing to do, just install it with composer

```bash
## Installation
```composer require voryx/event-loop:2.0```
